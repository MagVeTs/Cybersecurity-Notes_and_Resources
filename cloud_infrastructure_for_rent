https://exe.dev/docs/what-is-exe
"exe.dev is a subscription service that gives you virtual machines, with persistent disks, quickly and without fuss. These machines are immediately accessible over HTTPS, with sensible and secure defaults. You can share your web server as easily as you can share a Google Doc. With built-in optional authentication, so you can focus on your thing.

Your VMs share CPU/RAM. Create as many VMs as you like with the resources you have."
